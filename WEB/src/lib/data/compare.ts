			'Compare Kuayle and Linear by hosting model, license, issue workflow, planning, integrations, product maturity, and software cost.',
		heading: 'Kuayle vs Linear',
		intro:
			'Both products emphasize fast, keyboard-oriented issue tracking. The main decision is not superficial feature parity: Linear is a mature hosted product, while Kuayle is an early self-hosted project with complete source access and no software license fee.',
		sections: [
			{
				heading: 'Hosting and source access',
				body: 'The products use different delivery models.',
				list: [
					'Linear is a proprietary hosted service and does not offer a self-hosted edition.',
					'Kuayle is self-hosted from one public Apache 2.0 repository. There is no hosted Kuayle service.'
				]
			},
			{
				heading: 'Core issue tracking',
				body: 'Kuayle covers a smaller product surface but differs on issue ownership.',
				list: [
					'Linear provides a mature issue workflow, command menu, filters and keyboard shortcuts.',
					'Kuayle provides multiple assignees per issue, sub-issues, relations, labels, comments, saved views and team-specific statuses.'
				]
			},
			{
				heading: 'Planning: cycles and projects',
				body: 'Both products support time-boxed work and project grouping, but Linear’s planning layer is broader.',
				list: [
					'Linear: cycles, projects, roadmaps, and initiatives for grouping work across teams.',
					'Kuayle has cycles with burndown and velocity charts, projects with progress and a Gantt view, and workspace/team analytics with configurable insights. It has no initiatives layer.'
				]

			{
				heading: 'Integrations and automation',
				body: 'Check required integrations before choosing either product.',
				list: [
					'Linear: documents integrations for GitHub, GitLab, Slack, its API, and enterprise identity features.',
					'Kuayle integrates with GitHub and generic webhooks. Its development branch includes an unreleased opt-in Dev Machines subsystem for agentic coding runs. It does not currently provide GitLab, Slack, SSO, SCIM or LDAP integrations.'
				]
			},
			{
				heading: 'Cost model',
				body: 'Published prices and plan limits can change; the linked pricing page is authoritative.',
				list: [
					'Linear offers a limited free plan and paid per-user plans. Hosting and product operations are included in that service.',
					'Kuayle charges no software license fee. You pay for infrastructure and operate backups, monitoring and updates.'
				]
			},
			{
				heading: 'How to choose',
				body: 'Choose based on operating model and required maturity, not on headline similarity.',
				list: [
					'Choose Linear when a managed service, broader integrations and a mature product are more important than self-hosting.',
					'Choose Kuayle when self-hosting, multiple assignees, source access and no software license fee are hard requirements—and the current MVP covers your workflow.'
